First, I would like to thank my advisors, Jean Oh and Katharina Muelling for their mentorship and guidance for the past two years. I am extremely grateful to them for giving me the freedom to pursue research topics that I am excited about and provide their valuable insights to help me achieve my goals.

I would also like to thank a bunch of people for their technical assistance in several stages of my research: Pete Trautman for providing useful insights into a difficult problem, Venkatraman Narayanan for demistifying graph search and Kalin Gochev for going through the painstaking process of explaining SBPL code. I am also indebted to Sanjiban Choudhury for his constant guidance, since my days as an intern, in my research directions and for his thoughtful opinions.

A big shout out to my colleagues at the Robotics Institute, Puneet Puri, Vishal Dugar, Debidatta Dwibedi, Rosario Scalise, Sankalp Arora, Jerry Hsiung, Achal Dave, and many others for lending an ear when it was most needed. A special thanks goes to Puneet for the brainstorming sessions regarding our research, which helped me gain a better perspective.

Finally, I would like to thank my brother for pushing me to strive for the best and not settle for less, and my parents for their unwavering support of my choices in life.
